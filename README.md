Proposed Ideas:

1. Inventory App
  PipeTrack is a MERN stack web application that enables plumbing businesses to manage inventory per service van. The system allows users to generate and scan barcodes for parts, track item usage per job, calculate totals for invoicing, and receive restock alerts. Designed for mobile and tablet use in the field, the app helps ensure that each van remains fully stocked and that material costs are accurately tracked for each customer job.

2. AI document preparer
   Family law processes often involve complicated paperwork, unclear instructions, and significant emotional stress. Self-represented litigants frequently don't understand what documents they need, how to fill them out, or what information is relevant to their case. This leads to filing errors, rejections, and lost time. A smart platform that generates dynamic checklists, guides users through relevant questions, and auto-fills their forms using AI can dramatically reduce errors and empower individuals navigating the court system alone.

3. Legislative Letter
   Help everyday citizens engage with proposed laws by simplifying bills into understandable terms, generating guided questions, and writing advocacy letters based on users' viewsâ€”all powered by free/open AI tools.
